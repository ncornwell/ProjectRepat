<h1>Project Repatriation History:</h1>
<p>Project Repatriation was conceived by Sean Hewens during his first visit to Kenya with Smallbean. Upon descending into the depths of the Kibara slums in Nairobi and the horrible traffic that is prevalent in that part of the world…..</p>
<p>Did you know that 100% of the proceeds from the purchase of repatriated shirts support non-profit organizations that are improving lives in the developing world?</p>
<p>Project Repatriation is a collaborative project supporting the efforts of Smallbean and Newton-Tanzania Collaborative, Inc. (NTC), two non-profit organizations working to improve technology and education in places like Kenya and Tanzania. </p>
<p>Smallbean, Inc. is a non-profit organization committed to bridging the technology gap through the Citizen Archivist Project. Smallbean builds computer labs and teaches technology and computer skills integral for job creation and sustainable economic growth using an innovative curriculum that documents community life around the world. Smallbean’s initiatives are enabled by solar power and in-kind donations of personal electronics. </p>
<p>NTC’s mission is to build relationships between students and citizens from the United States and Tanzania, ultimately empowering both sides to improve educational opportunities for children in Tanzania. Since 2006, NTC has worked with a rural community in Tanzania called Kwala, just 80 KM west of Dar es Salaam, initiating cultural exchange projects between students, facilitating exchange visits to and from Kwala, and working with NTC’s Kwala Committee to implement high-impact projects that improve educational opportunities for children in Kwala, including water and sanitation, children’s literacy, library and textbook, and girls scholarship projects. </p>
<p>In February 2010, Smallbean partnered with NTC to build a solar-powered computer lab at Kwala Secondary School and run Smallbean’s Citizen Archivist Project, training students how to use the technology to document elements of their own culture, including oral history interviews.</p>
