# Represents a downloadable file linked to a product.
# Added as a subclass of 'UserUpload' because we already
# have support for uploading / managing files.
#
# Customers may purchase digital downloads (photos, mp3s, whatever)
# and will receive a download link upon finishing their order. 
#
# They will also get this link in their email receipt generated
# by the system.
